          <p>In recent years, the culinary landscape in India has witnessed a burgeoning interest in artisanal food. This trend has been driven by a growing consumer demand for authentic and unique dining experiences, where traditional cooking techniques and handpicked ingredients are valued over mass-produced foods. Artisanal food represents a return to the roots of cooking, where the focus is on quality over quantity and the celebration of the craft of cooking. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for something that is handmade, unique, and reflects the local culture and traditions.

Vijay Thapliyal, executive chef, The Lodhi, Delhi says, “At The Lodhi, we recognize the importance of authenticity and the value of traditional cooking methods. Our team of chefs are dedicated to incorporating artisanal techniques in our dishes, using the finest ingredients sourced from local farmers and markets. Committed to providing our guests with a truly unique dining experience that celebrates the diverse and rich culinary heritage of India. Our menu features a range of artisanal dishes, crafted with a fine touch, resulting in a flavour profile that is unmatched by mass-produced foods. Each dish is carefully crafted, with attention to detail and a passion for the craft of cooking.”</p>
