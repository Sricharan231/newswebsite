          West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has condemned the comments made on Prophet Muhammad by BJP leaders.

Terming the remarks ‘hate speech’, Mamata Banerjee said that these remarks led to ‘spread of violence’ and ‘division of the (secular) fabric of the country’.

BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma had made controversial remarks on Prophet Muhammad during a TV show. BJP had later on suspended Sharma while issuing a statement asserting that it respects all religions and strongly denounces insult of any religious personality. The party had also expelled its Delhi unit media head Naveen Kumar Jindal for his tweets supporting her.

"I condemn the recent heinous and atrocious hate speech remarks by a few disastrous BJP leaders, resulting in not only spread of violence, but also division of the fabric of the country, leading to disturbance of peace and amity," Mamata Banerjee said through one of her tweets.

"I strongly seek that the accused leaders of BJP be arrested immediately so that the unity of the country is not disturbed and people at large do not face mental agony," Mamata Banerjee’s second tweet read.

The West Bengal chief minister also appealed people of all religions and communities to maintain peace and harmony in the country.
